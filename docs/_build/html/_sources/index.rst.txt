Compare Equal Module
=========================================

Welcome to the Compare-Equal's documentation.

Compare Equal is a package of two functions for `UCSF Chimera <https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/>`_
to compare if two molecules are equal. You can compare either two Python variables 
of the Chimera's Molecule class or directly two PDB files.
